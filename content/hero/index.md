A self-motivated and detail-oriented software developer who is passionate about JVM and Android development. With a strong foundation in software design, object-oriented, event-driven paradigm, agile development, and testing, I strive to deliver high-performance solutions under budgetary constraints.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at [Finastra](https://www.finastra.com/) where I focus on automating instant payment processing solutions for 90 out of 100 world's largest banks.

In my free time, I undertake personal and freelance projects to experiment with different technologies, primarily in the fields of Mobile Development, Cloud Technologies, DevOps, and Backend-related Infrastructures.

If you're looking to turn your ideas into apps, I'd be happy to help.

I also often contribute and gave back to the open-source community by contributing and engaging in a community discussion, adding PR features, submitting issues, and peer code reviews. -->

<!-- On my freetime, I do a lot of personal projects where I experiment different technologies, most primarily in the field of Mobile Development, Cloud Technologies, and Backend Infrastructures.
I also often contribute and gave back to the open-source community by contributing and engaging in a community discussion, adding PR features, submitting issues, and peer code reviews. -->

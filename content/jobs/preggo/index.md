- Led the delopment from designing the architectural solutions like **multi‑module**, **MVI on top of MVVM**; integrating third‑party libraries
  such as **Android Jetpack**, **Dagger2**, **Material Design**, **LeakCanary**, **Retrofit**, **OkHttp**, **Firebase**, and **Crashlytics**.
- Developed and optimized the core and complex UI components by breaking it into smaller chunks of custom views, **reducing the jitter and flicker effect by 80% for lower devices and below API level 23**.
- Incharge for the maintenance of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment for the entire project lifecycle: **AdminSDK**, **AppEngine**, **Firestore**, **Cloud Storage**, **Firebase**, **Cron Schedulers**, and the **GCM & Cloud Engine** infrastructure.
- Fixed and improved REST API calls by introducing a separate backend server using **Spring Boot MVC framework** on top of **Spring Cloud GCP**, which reduces the GCP billing usage by up to 27-31% per month. (**dev environment**)
- Written both Android and backend using **Kotlin** with **Flows & Coroutines**, **RxKotlin**, and **Guava Future** APIs for parallelism and structured concurrency.
- Collaborated with a [UI/UX designer](https://www.behance.net/maritheygraine) and [Web Developer](https://www.behance.net/jeaaanius) to build a great user experience.

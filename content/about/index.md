Greetings! I go by Aljan, or Force if you prefer. My passion for software development began during my third semester as a freshman student at [FEU Institute of Technology](https://web.facebook.com/feueac) when I was first introduced to the world of Android app development. From there, my excitement and curiosity turned into a full-fledged passion.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took advantage of the extra time and taught myself more about the Android ecosystem. I dove deep into topics like depdency injection, software design patterns, concurrency, architectures, lifecycles, and the latest trends in the Android community, including the Jetpack libraries, Dagger2, Hilt, Navigation, Room, Compose UI, and many more. I even started contributing to <i>[open-source projects](https://github.com/mayokunadeniyi/Instant-Weather/pull/24)</i>.

My dedication and hard work paid off when I landed five consecutive freelance projects, which helped me sustain my college expenses for almost two years and a half before graduation. These projects gave me invaluable experience in software development and led me to acquire a full-time position before I graduated.

Today, I am fortunate to work as a full-time software engineer in the top global FinTech providers while also pursuing freelance development on the side. 

I also recently had the privilege of speaking at [University of San Agustin](https://usa.edu.ph/) for the [Google Student Developer Clubs](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=158422026947851&set=pcb.158422076947846), where I shared my knowledge of [Using Firebase in Android Apps](https://speakerdeck.com/forceporquillo/introducing-firebase-in-android-apps) along with one of the famous youtuber for Android development [Stevdza San](https://www.youtube.com/@StevdzaSan).

Here are the technologies I've used for my freelancing, full-time, and personal projects, in case you are wondering:

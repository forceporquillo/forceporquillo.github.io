Hello! My name is Aljan, but you can also call me Force as well. I am currently a Computer Science - Software Engineering student from [FEU Institute of Technology](https://web.facebook.com/feueac). Way back from my freshmen year, 3rd semester. I got introduced to mobile development. Since then, my excitement and curiosity in building Android apps turned into a passion.

Recently, before and amidst the COVID19 pandemic. I taught myself to learn more about the Android ecosystem, lifecycles, architectures, and current trends in the Android community, such as the Jetpack Libraries. <i><small>[This also opens me to the world of becoming an open-source contributor](https://github.com/mayokunadeniyi/Instant-Weather/pull/24)</small></i>

Day by day, I started to develop more personal apps, which will be my training ground to sharpen my skills <i><small>(Driven by doing and hunger to learn more)</small></i> and become relevant to the Android industry.

Fast forward today, someone noticed my hard work and dedication which helped me got an offer for three consecutive freelance Android projects, which I can proudly says that I've exceeded all of my client's expectations in a span of 1 and a half year.

As of today, I am currently working as a freelance solo developer for the [PregGo](https://www.behance.net/gallery/138550555/PregGo-App) Android App.

If you are wondering what techonologies I've used, here are the list of technologies that I've implemented primarily on my freelancing projects and personal projects!
